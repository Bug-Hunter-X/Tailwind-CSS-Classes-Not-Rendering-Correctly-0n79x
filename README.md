# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not rendering as expected.  The problem lies in a simple oversight often made by developers new to Tailwind or when working with complex projects.

## Problem Description

A simple div element is styled with several Tailwind classes to create a styled box. However, the styles are not applied correctly, and the div appears without the intended background, padding, or shadow.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the Tailwind CSS directives are correctly included in your project and that your configuration is appropriate. This usually involves checking your `tailwind.config.js` file and making sure the `content` array includes all the templates or components where you are using Tailwind classes.
